Details/functionality: Use to the top navigation menu to cycle between pages. The first page includes a carousel of the resturants featured items. The menu displays
the resturants selection of menu items. The reservation page allows the user to make a reservation by filling out the form and clicking the submit button. Each page contains a footer 
that links to the resturants contact informatoin and usage policy. Note: Must install PHP for form to work properly.

Ideas for future improvement: Create a menu with tab navigation for each category. Add a pop-up modal for each menu item to get a closer look. Allow users to place online orders.
